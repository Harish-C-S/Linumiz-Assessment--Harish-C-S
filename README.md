# Linumiz-Assessment--Harish-C-S
Assessment 
I have Used Single Linked List, To Reverse a string word after word

Finally i have used recursion to print the word in the reverse order.


For Compilation :
gcc Linked-list-Problem-Linumiz.c -o Solution

I have also attached the Compiled Binary File to it

I used the Linux Machine to run it so it runs in Linux.
